# WordPress Parallax Content Slider

A customizable JQuery content slider with CSS3 animations and parallax effects.

## Features

* The Plugin is fully-based on the WordPress [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API)
* i18n support: Ready for translation using .po files (http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers)
* WPML support: Queries, option management and strings declaration are made to work with [WPML](http://wpml.org/documentation/theme-compatibility/go-global-program/)
* Adds automatically a content slider of your last posts where you want on your WordPress blog or website
* Shortcode support
* Transitions between slides are made using a powerfull combination of CSS3 and JQuery to display a beautiful parallax effect
* Very easy to configure as it adds automatically an admin page in WordPress administration section
* Offers the possibility to choose to display a static HTML content instead of displaying last posts in the slider

Some of the parameters you can manage in the admin section are listed below:
* The type of content to display (posts, pages, both) ;
* The number of slides to display ;
* The auto-switch mode ;
* The time between each slide ;
* The sort order of the content to display ;
* The graphic theme ;
* and many more...
